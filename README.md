## Project Description 🗺️

CV Descent is a backend application that processes images in real time. It receives a selfie captured by a web interface and applies a barrel distortion effect using OpenCV. The processed image is then sent back to the frontend for display, creating an engaging visual experience for live demos and hackathons.

## Project Set-up & Configuration 💻

### Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask (Installable via pip)
- OpenCV-Python (Installable via pip)
- Numpy (Installable via pip)

## Skills Demonstrated 🖌️

This project showcases:
- **Backend API Development:** Building a RESTful API with Flask to handle image uploads and processing.
- **Image Processing:** Utilizing OpenCV and Numpy to apply a barrel distortion effect to images.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly connecting a JavaScript-based frontend with a Python backend.
- **Deployment:** Preparing the application for live demonstrations, deployable on platforms like Render.

## Contributing ⚙️

We believe that knowledge is best when shared. Contributions that enhance image processing techniques, improve API functionality, or optimize deployment strategies are highly encouraged. Feel free to fork the repository, implement your ideas, and submit a pull request. Together, let's push the boundaries of real-time image processing!
